I was thinking about how I want to approach my fursona today. I spent this past weekend at Anthro Northwest, and attended a lot of really good panels.

I think I’ve come to the conclusion that although computers and software have been my primary creative output, taking up a software project is an inherently burdened form of self expression.

Not that you *can’t* make software for yourself, but the art form is predicated upon making things that are useful for others, and that brings a significant burden onto any project you would begin. Why would I do something if there’s a solution that already exists on GitHub? I’m too pragmatic for that.

Other forms of art don’t really have that issue. Paintings and music have inherent value simply as forms of self expression. They’re not predicated upon the notion of needing a use in order to justify their continued existence.

It’s easy for me to say that because my existence isn’t reliant upon them, of course. I’ve got a really well paying software job. But that’s my perspective on the situation and I can’t change it. All I can do is acknowledge other perspectives.

Of course, I’m not saying that art doesn’t have value. There’s a lot of value in making people (and yourself!!) happy.

The key thing is: I’ve realized that unlike software, other artistic pursuits aren't as attached to being original.

I mean, this is obvious in retrospect. “Good artists copy, great artists steal” and all. I guess I was slow on the uptake. For the longest time, I never thought I could be “a creative”, because I couldn’t come up with “original ideas”.

I’ve realized this notion of “originality” is a false construction of my own mind. My favorite media is all about wearing its influences on its sleeve. Even Mother Fucking Star Wars was a rip-off with a different spin, but it’s still excellent and valuable!

I’m going to shed this concern in 2023. It’s time to start doing things because I like them, and time to stop feeling like I need to satisfy others with the stuff I make.

...Did I just stumble into post-modernism?

Oh well. Happy New Year! Full-speed into 2023!
