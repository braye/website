## hello, internet

### :leopard: :earth_americas: :sushi:

This is a place on the internet where I'm going to put my thoughts. I think we used to call these, "websites".

You can call me snepi, or nepi, or nep. I get insane about technology, and I now live in the Seattle area after deciding that homes in the midwest were too reasonably priced. I've been using linux since middle school and I managed to turn it into a day job, which is pretty cool. I've always had a fondness for hardware though, so hopefully this blog ends up giving me an excuse to do experiments and learnings in that area. After all, half the fun of doing something is getting to post it on the internet!
