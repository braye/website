# Hi!

Thanks for checking out my blog. I'm a software developer/sysadmin living near Seattle. I like to write, but I do it less often than I'd like. Writing is a really important skill for software devs, I think - it's pretty much always the case that the difficult part about creating software is how it interfaces with *people*. That's what I'm trying to practice here.

The topics I write about aren't always computer-related, but they'll usually be technical in some way. Whether the engineering behind something is electronic or mechanical doesn't really matter much to me. I love it all the same.

Thanks for stopping by!
